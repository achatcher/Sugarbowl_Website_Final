Absolutely! Let me walk you through creating a Google Cloud account and setting up your API key step by step.
Step 1: Create Google Cloud Account

Go to Google Cloud Console
Sign in with your Google account (or create one if needed)
Accept the terms when prompted
You'll get $300 in free credits (more than enough for calendar API calls)

Step 2: Create a New Project

Click the project dropdown at the top (next to "Google Cloud")
Click "New Project"
Name your project (e.g., "SugarBowl Website" or "Restaurant Calendar")
Click "Create"
Wait for project creation (takes ~30 seconds)
Select your new project from the dropdown

Step 3: Enable Google Calendar API

In the search bar, type "Calendar API"
Click on "Google Calendar API"
Click "Enable" button
Wait for it to enable (~10 seconds)

Step 4: Create API Key

Go to "Credentials" (left sidebar or search for it)
Click "+ Create Credentials" at the top
Select "API Key"
Copy your API key immediately (it will look like: AIzaSyC...)
Click "Restrict Key" (important for security)

Step 5: Restrict Your API Key (Security)

Name your key (e.g., "SugarBowl Calendar Key")
Under "API restrictions":
Select "Restrict key"
Check only "Google Calendar API"


Under "Website restrictions":
Select "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
Add your website domains:
http://localhost:* (for testing)
https://yourdomain.com/* (your actual domain)
https://www.yourdomain.com/* (with www)




Click "Save"

Step 6: Test Your Setup
Update your calendar.js with your new API key:
const CONFIG = {
    googleCalendarId: 'CALENDAR_ID_GOES_HERE', // Client will provide this
    apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE', // ‚Üê Paste your API key here
    maxResults: 100,
    syncEnabled: true,
    useLocalEvents: true,
    cacheExpiration: 1800,
    debugMode: true
};
Step 7: Get Client's Calendar ID
Send these instructions to your client:

Open Google Calendar
Find the calendar you want to use for the restaurant
Click the 3 dots next to the calendar name
Select "Settings and sharing"
Scroll down to "Integrate calendar"
Copy the "Calendar ID" (looks like abc123@group.calendar.google.com)
Make the calendar public:
Scroll to "Access permissions for events"
Check "Make available to public"
Select "See all event details"
Click "Save"



Important Notes:

API Key is free for reasonable usage (Google Calendar API allows 1,000,000 requests/day)
Keep your API key secure - don't commit it to public repositories
Client's calendar must be public for this method to work
Test locally first before deploying

What You'll Need from Client:
Just their Calendar ID once they make the calendar public and follow Step 7 above.
Let me know when you've got your API key created and I'll help you test the connection!
